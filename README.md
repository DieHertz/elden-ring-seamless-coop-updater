### Why?
Each update of the [SeamlessCoop](https://github.com/LukeYui/EldenRingSeamlessCoopRelease) mod set us back for a while because I had to walk my friend through the update process, so I wrote this script.

### How to use
1. Download the script somewhere
2. Edit the script changing the `PASSWORD` variable according to your preferences, optionally edit the path to `ELDEN RING/Game` directory
3. Add the script to `Non-Steam Games` somehow
4. Run each time you launch `ELDEN RING`, or periodically, or else
