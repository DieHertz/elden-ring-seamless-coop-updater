### Why?
Each update of the [SeamlessCoop](https://github.com/LukeYui/EldenRingSeamlessCoopRelease) mod set us back a while because I had to walk my friend through the update process on his **Steam Deck**, so I wrote this script.

### How to use
1. Download the script somewhere on your device (tested on a SteamDeck running latest 3.6 OS)
2. Edit the script changing the `PASSWORD` variable according to your preferences, optionally edit the path to `ELDEN RING/Game` directory
3. Add the script to `Non-Steam Games`. E.g. add `Konsole` and set `Launch Options` to `-e python3 /home/deck/Downloads/main.py` if you have downloaded the script as `~/Downloads/main.py`
4. Run each time you launch `ELDEN RING`, or periodically, or else

### Supported OSes:
* SteamOS
* Probably other Linux distributions based on Python3.x availability out of the box
